# Project 1

### Command Line Application

Build a command line application that has two commands named `help` and `bac`.

The `help` command should give you a paragraph of what the application does and how to use it.

The `bac` (Blood Alcohol Content) command should do the following:
 - [ ] Ask your name
 - [ ] Ask your gender
 - [ ] Ask how many beers you had
 - [ ] Ask how many hours has it been since your last beer
 - [ ] It should give you your alcohol content
 - [ ] Tell you if your able to drive or not


 *Hints:*

 *Refer to module 1 exercise 6 https://github.com/codetrotters/online-modules-node-web/tree/master/module-1/exercises/6*

 *Refer to https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_argv for help with command line arguments*


Challenge:

 Make the console color coded:
  `help` command should be yellow output
  `bac` command should be `green` if I can drive or `red` if I cannot

  Also after you start typing the first input for the `bac` command to clear
  everything away from the terminal.
